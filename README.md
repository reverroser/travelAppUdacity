# travelAppUdacity

This is a full JS server/client project for Udacity Frontend Developer nanodegree.

In this project you can list and manage trips (add and delete).

Using 3 different apis (Geonames, Weatherbit, and Pixabay), the server builds an entire trip with destination, dates, weather and destination image.

The client displays a grid of trips showing the full information that the server returns plus the time left to the trip date.
